A repository for the SCC110 whatever-the-final-term-is-called term coursework.
The project involves Java and Swing content, which I decided was slightly less painful than writing in C, the language where the best I could do was say: At least I submitted something, even if that something didn't get me anywhere.
Anyway, I think I'm targetting project 3, because I love Hex values, like that time I tried editing hex values in the Sonic Generations exe and made the shadows 4K, that was fun, or the time I changed things in Mass Effect 3,, and made everyones skin green. That wasn't fun.
Let's hope this is a fun one, it involves CSV's! Woo!
